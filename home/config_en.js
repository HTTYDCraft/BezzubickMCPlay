## Hey, hi! I'm **Bezzubick MCPlay**, or just Bezz

Glad to see you here. Imagine: a cozy corner of the internet with no room for toxicity or swearing. But plenty of humor, chill streams, and Minecraft. My channel is like a big online family where everyone's on the same wavelength.

What do I do here? Let's break it down:
- **Let's Plays and Maps**: Stories, challenges, horrors... Especially horrors! Remember how you got scared of shadows as a kid? Yeah, that's me :) (yep, I was scared too, what did you think?)
- **Experiments**: Trying new formats, servers, and even story-driven stuff. My team is already cooking up an awesome plot-based let's play — I'll show it soon, stay tuned!
- **Meme Shorts**: They blew up the channel, but the real highlight is the big videos and streams. It'd be boring without them, right?

## And what about streams? That's a whole separate love
Mostly on YouTube, Fridays from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM MSK. If plans fall through (life happens), I post right away in Telegram. We play with friends and you, the subscribers: mods, survival, mini-games — whatever the chat votes for! I chat the whole stream, read donations, joke around. Imagine: you're sitting with popcorn, and we're building epics in Minecraft or running from creepers. Awesome?

This year is like a reboot for me: I want to make content that I'm thrilled about myself. Plans? Fire!
- Finish and launch the plot-based let's play — it's gonna be epic, trust me.
- Sort out the categories and playlists so everything's convenient, like in your favorite game.
- Upgrade the tech: new mic and camera — so watching is a blast, not just "eh, it'll do."
- Keep it stable: streams and videos on schedule, no excuses.

I'm also thinking about my own server. Not just "survival," but a place with stories — where mechanics help with chatting, not get in the way. Imagine: we're building, laughing, creating memes there. Sounds tempting? And mini-games too! Okay, I'm getting carried away, that's probably not for this year))

On April 13, my most viral Shorts blew up — bam, +200k subscribers! Cool? You bet. But here's the catch: the Shorts was multilingual, and the activity just vanished! Main content is in Russian, then YouTube slowdown in Russia plus my studies — that combo meant videos came out less often than I wanted. (Or to put it simply, they barely came out at all)

But I learned: better to do what I love. Now I'm back, focusing on quality and stability. No fuss, but with soul. What do you think is more important — quantity or the fun of watching?

Upgraded my PC and the visuals finally got smooth, editing flies, streams without lags. It's like switching from a bike to a sports car. More experiments, ideas, freedom — finally, I can bring to life everything spinning in my head. The year I felt: "Whoa, this is my level." But then things went sideways in my personal life... But that's another story)

                bodyMd: `
Switched to PC — and the channel came alive. Got the "Community" tab (back then they gave it for 500 subs), and on September 20 — boom, 1000 followers! That was a breakthrough.

From that year, I remember:
- **One Block**: Brought it to victory, with sweat and tears (well, almost... okay, I just beat it. Just! Yeah...).
- **World in a Jar**: Cool experiment, but closed it — didn't click like I expected.
- **LimonchikCraft**: First Java let's play! Started vanilla, then added mods, and then it kinda faded...

Shot a lot with Foxy MCPE — well, not much more to say. And I removed all the CPD videos so YouTube wouldn't get confused in the algorithms. Lesson: focus is power.

On October 20, my first Minecraft video came out: a let's play on phone, pure vanilla, goal — all achievements. No cheats, from scratch — like a real newbie. It was awesome: learned to play, edit, laugh at my fails. A start like that sticks with you forever. What's your first Minecraft moment?

It all started here: created the channel, but at first it wasn't about games, but the "How to Train Your Dragon" fandom. First subscribers came through clips, and the video about Dragons: The Nine Realms got 114k views — whoa, not bad for a start, I thought!

## My People and What's Important

The channel isn't just videos, it's a community. Cozy, where everyone supports each other, jokes, and shares stories. No swearing or negativity — I consider you my online family. Main audience: Russian-speaking Minecraft fans (English subtitles are there, but the focus isn't on them).

### What I Love in Minecraft
- **RPG packs**, maps, servers, survivals, vanilla, meow-meow and mini-games: BedWars, "Words," "Pillars" — it's always fun.
- My own server? Just an idea for now, but I want to make an atmospheric place for stories and chatting.
- No public maps, but sometimes I build for friends — if you ask, maybe I'll whip something up for you.

### Beyond Games
I love tech: PCs, smartphones, smartwatches, and more. I enjoy tinkering with code and programs. And shooting videos — that's the main thing. By the way, I have a profession as a videographer :)

### How I Communicate
Energetically, friendly, on a "you" basis — but if "formal you" is more comfortable, just say! We don't touch politics: the channel is for all ages, I want it to be calm and fun. Read more about the rules somewhere else) If you have ideas or just wanna chat — write in Telegram or comments. Let's make this place even cooler together!
